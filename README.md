# Webstore

This is a fully-responsive webstore built using React and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to apply all the skills and technologies I've learned. Functionality includes the ability to add/remove items to/from the cart, view the cart, adjust quantity of items in cart, empty cart, etc. The Commerce.js API was used to store the products displayed on the webstore.
